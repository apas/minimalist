###mnmlist WordPress Theme, tweaked by apas
/RTFM/

I made several changes to mnmlist theme and re-uploading it, as is. It is a very clean and minimalist WordPress theme that focuses on the content without distractions. One (left) sidebar, no-widgets ouf-of-the-box (you can add if you want) and simple comments.

### Changes made:
* sidebar is css fixed, only main content is scrollable
* a new design approach on links both in main content and post, changed their css 
* html "placeholder" for an image in sidebar
* twitter & facebook share/like buttons under each post
* rss icon in sidebar
* helvetica font, not verdana
* a few other minor and subtle changes I cannot remember of now

### To-do:
* add a search form above archives page, also search landing page

### Notes:
* in single.php, if you want to keep the twitter share button, go to twitter and re-grab the code; otherwise after someone clicks it, it will pop-up to follow my twitter and not yours
* in order to use the contact page properly, install a contact forms plugin
* I've put "YOUR THIS" and "YOUR THAT" in every HTML tag which you need for to personalize the theme with your info
