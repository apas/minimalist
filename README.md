/RTFM/

apas
I made several changes to mnmlist theme and re-uploading it, as is. It is a very clean and minimalist WordPress theme that focuses on the content without distractions. One (left) sidebar, no-widgets ouf-of-the-box (you can add if you want) and simple comments.

zapperpro
I also made serveral changes to the theme. Removing socials, I mean, they are not really clean and minimal. More focus
on creating a simple ease-to-use theme including custom menu and widget support.

### Changes made | zapperpro:
* sidebar isnt fixed, ehm again
* html "placeholder" for an image in sidebar, configure through backend as URL in Wordpress main settings
* removed social icons, rss icon
* helvetica font, not verdana

### The search page how-to:
* removed Google custom search.
